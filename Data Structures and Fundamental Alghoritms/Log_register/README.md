This program reads the txt file (that has up to 10 thousand logs); sorts them using different methods including bubble sort (ev1), quick sort (ev2) and heap sort(ev3); shows a range of data (between specific dates, ip or most repeated in one attribute); and implements different data structures to save the log struct such as binary search tree (Evidence 3) or Doubly Linked List (evidence 2). 

As I implemented different tools and algorithms throught the course on solving the same project, I learned to find different ways to solve a specific problem, annalize my situation and implement the logic that is needed to guarantee a better outcome. I also reflected after each version, to see how my code had evolved, how the respective bigO Noation was to see if it was more efficient to solve it using that method.
