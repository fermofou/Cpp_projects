# Film and Series rater
 A teammate and I were tasked with making a code that, through a repetitive menu, shows all videos with a specific rating or from a specific genre, showing the episodes of a specific series with a specific rating and allows the user rate a video. 

 We were tasked to make a way for users to modify a database using input prompts, with the use of principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, pointers and operator overloading to allow the correct use of our file.
